# Backend Golang Project

This project is a backend application written in Golang with Multithreading, Kafka, OpenCV and ChatGPT integration.

## Multithreading

Multithreading is used to improve the performance of the application by allowing multiple tasks to be executed concurrently. This allows for faster execution of tasks and improved scalability.

## Kafka

Kafka is an open-source distributed streaming platform that allows for real-time data streaming and processing. It is used to process large amounts of data quickly and reliably.

## OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. It is used to detect objects in images or videos, identify facial features, and perform other image processing tasks.

## ChatGPT Integration

ChatGPT (Chatbot Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is an open source library for natural language processing (NLP). It enables developers to build conversational AI applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and more. The integration of this library into the project allows for more natural conversations with users.

This project uses these technologies to create a powerful backend application that can handle large amounts of data quickly and reliably while providing a more natural user experience through its use of NLP technology.
